Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote.

```
“Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.” 
― Dr. Seuss
```


Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.
